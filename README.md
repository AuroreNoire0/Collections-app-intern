# Collections-app-intern
Deployed application:  https://collection-app0.herokuapp.com/

Do you have a personal collection of books and you want to control it online? Or maybe you want to show your collection of cars to whole world? 
Use Collection App!
Collection App is an application to create and manage your own collections of different items. 
If you have account and you are logged in, you can manage them: add, edit or delete collection and add, edit and delete each item in this collection. Fields that you will use to describe items in given collection depends on you, you can define them during creating collection. As user without account you have read-only access, so you can see all collections and items, for exemple by searching items that correspond to one of tag from a tag cloud at the bottom of the page or by using search bar to find items containing another word, however only logged in user can leave a like or comments. 
Application support two languages (English and Polish) and two visual mode (dark and light).
New user by default is not an admin. Only admin can manage users- block, unblock, delete or add/remove admin role.


Application is created entirely by me as course project during the internship.
